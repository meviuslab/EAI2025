<!--                 <strong>Short bio</strong>: Dr. Christopher A. White is the President of NEC Laboratories America where he leads a team of world-class researchers focusing on diverse topics from sensing to networking to machine learning based understanding. Prior to joining NEC he spent 22 years working at Bell Labs where he led the Algorithms, Analytics, Augmented Intelligence and Devices (AAAID) research lab. He joined Bell Labs in 1997 after graduating with a Ph.D. in theoretical quantum chemistry from the University of California in Berkeley, California. His research interests include the development of computational models and methods for the simulation and control of interesting physical and digital systems. This has included work in areas ranging from linear scaling quantum chemistry simulations, to the design of new optical devices, to the global control of transparent optical mesh networks and to understanding and facilitating the propagation of ideas in organizations. In addition to the management of a team of world-class researchers, Dr. White's current work focuses on the creation of assisted thinking tools that leverage structural similarity in data with the goal of augmenting human intelligence. -->

                <strong>Short bio</strong>: 
                Dr. Li is an Assistant Professor at the University of Virginia. His research interests are data mining and machine learning, focusing on graph machine learning, trustworthy/safe machine learning, and, more recently, large language models. 
                He has published over 150 papers in high-impact venues (including KDD, NeruIPS, ICLR, WWW, SIGIR, WSDM, IJCAI, AAAI, SIGIR, ACL, EMNLP, CIKM, ICDM, SDM, ECML-PKDD, CSUR, TPAMI, TKDE, TKDD, TIST, etc.), with over 10,000 citation count. 
                He has won several prestigious awards, including SIGKDD Best Research Paper Award (2022), NSF CAREER Award (2022), PAKDD Early Career Research Award (2023), JP Morgan Chase Faculty Research Award (2021 \& 2022), Cisco Faculty Research Award (2021), and being selected for the AAAI New Faculty Highlights roster (2021). 
                His group's research is generously supported by NSF (CAREER, III, SaTC, SAI), DOE, Commonwealth Cyber Initiative, Jefferson Lab, JP Morgan, Cisco, and Snap.

                <strong>Short bio</strong>: 
                Dr. Johnson is an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Claremont McKenna College. Their work focuses on the Philosophy of Psychology (particularly perception and social cognition), Philosophy of Mind, Philosophy of Science, and Philosophy of Technology.
                Her current research explores theories of bias beyond individual agents, examining how biases manifest in domains such as machine learning systems, scientific inference, statistical models of the visual perceptual system, and broader societal and structural injustices.
